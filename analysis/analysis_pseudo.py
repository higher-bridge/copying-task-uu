# Test how well each model fits the measured data
#   Do for each condition, aggregate results

# Could be done by calculating MSE over all metrics below. 
# e.g., calculate the MSE over all conditions, per metric. Then sum them up

# Possibly look at:
# - Number of saccades towards example grid
# - Number of items placed after looking at example grid
# - Total duration
# -
